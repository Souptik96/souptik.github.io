Hi, I'm **Souptik Chakraborty** — a Risk & Compliance Analyst with over 4 years of experience at Amazon. I specialize in AML/KYC risk modeling, control governance, SQL-based data analytics, and process automation.

I’ve helped build and deploy risk controls that have prevented over **$13.6M in fraud**, and improved internal audit readiness by 30%.

🔍 I’m passionate about data-driven decision making, and currently exploring how AI and real-time dashboards can modernize compliance operations.

📫 You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souptik-chakraborty-67385a18a/) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Souptik96).
